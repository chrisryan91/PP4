# Wasteless Plate: Ingredient Search & Recipe Reviews

Wasteless Plate is an online tool that encourages users to avoid throwing away food by encouraging them to use up what items they already have in the kitchen. A search function provides recipes tailored to what ingredients the user has at hand. Users are invited to join and contribute to a community of people reviewing, sharing and updating recipes. 

Ireland is estimated to generate 1.1 million tonnes of food waste per year, according to the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.ie/publications/circular-economy/resources/nature-and-extent-update-15th-June.pdf)
