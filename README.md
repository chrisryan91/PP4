# Wasteless Table: Ingredient Search & Recipe Reviews

Wasteless Table is an online tool and blog that encourages users to avoid throwing away food by encouraging them to use up what items they already have in the kitchen. A search function provides recipes tailored to what ingredients the user has at hand. Users are invited to join and contribute to a community of people reviewing, sharing and updating recipes. 

Ireland is estimated to generate 1.1 million tonnes of food waste per year, according to the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.ie/publications/circular-economy/resources/nature-and-extent-update-15th-June.pdf)
